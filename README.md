# 06-Application for parking ticket-machine

#### Introduction:
This project is a DevOps school-project that is divided into two sprints, where I'm responsible for the first and another student from my class will takeover the project for the final sprint. The project itself is a Python and Tkinter based GUI application that simulates a car parking ticket machine. 

#### Project overview:
The concept is about creating a GUI application with Python/Tkinter and use a SQLite database to store related data. The GUI application simulates a car parking ticket machine for a parking lot with 50 parking spots. The parking lot has a pricelist where the ticket itself will be mailed to the ''car driver'' (Mailhog) as a receipt in PDF-format.

The main features of the application are the following:
* Start parking
* See status for parked car
* Stop parking

#### Deeper documentation:
More advanced and detailed documentation about planning, database, sprints, features and todo will be found in the PDF file in the repository. There is also documentation about task tracking for each sprint and feature.
